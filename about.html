            <p>We are the Wagner Luddites. Today we have the same essential argument the Luddites were having, but on a vastly larger and more complex scale. AI is today's Gothenburg's printing press. The real parallel is not in the act of breaking machines, but in the fundamental question: How do we manage a technological revolution in a way that distributes its benefits widely and mitigates its human cost? The Luddites failed because they had no political power and were crushed by the state. The challenge for our society is to learn from their story and address the disruptions of AI bot with suppression, but with foresight, intelligent regulation, and a renewed commitment to social welfare, ensuring that the AI revolution does not create a new class of the economically dispossessed.</p>
